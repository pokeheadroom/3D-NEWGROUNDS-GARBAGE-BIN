# 3D-NEWGROUNDS-GARBAGE-BIN
so basically this repo will host newgrounds related 3d models made by me
uhm so even though i make my own textures some times, some of the textures i ocasionally use in my models come from the folowing sites
https://ambientcg.com/
https://polyhaven.com/all
https://www.sharetextures.com/tag/leather/
https://freepbr.com/
https://www.texturecan.com/

NOTE: the rigs on this batch of models are very bad but at the time of me writing this i wont have much time to fix em due to some other projects i am a part of (mainly render96 and ocarina of time's render98) or irl interfering.
also if you use these models you have to publish your work under the same license as this repo and credit the artists who created these characters as well of crediting me for making the 3d models of said characters that i dont own
